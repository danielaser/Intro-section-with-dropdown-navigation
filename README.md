## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

When I started this challenge I decided to use a JS librery as Bootstrap because this tool is very useful for Navbars. Also, this librery has the
CSS and some JavaScript already implemented. I believe that if you wanat to build a simple but nice webside, Boostrap can be the best way to do it. 

Bootstrap example below:

```html
<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg">
      <div class="container-fluid mx-3">
```
```html
<div class="offcanvas offcanvas-end" tabindex="-1" id="offcanvasNavbar" aria-labelledby="offcanvasNavbarLabel">
    <div class="offcanvas-header justify-content-end pb-0">
        <button type="button" class="btn-close ps-4" data-bs-dismiss="offcanvas" aria-label="Close"></button>
    </div>
    <div class="offcanvas-body">
    </div>
```

### Continued development

I will continue with another challenges that help me to improve my JavaScript and try to implement SASS to go deep in CSS style.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) - This helped me for make a nice intro page. I really liked this librery and will use it going forward.
